# Dockerized Simplified Multiplayer Scrabble (Scrabble for New Horizon)

This project is a fork of [CDOT's Xanado]([https://github.com/hanshuebner/html-scrabble](https://github.com/cdot/Xanado)], and [Hans Hübner's html-scrabble](https://github.com/hanshuebner/html-scrabble). Thanks to these great developers.

This project serves 2 purposes:
1. It adds a simplified English dictionary for English Language Learners, based on the Oxford 5000 Word List (https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/wordlists/oxford3000-5000), Oxford Phrase List, and the Japanese New Horizon English textbook word list (https://ten.tokyo-shoseki.co.jp/text/chu/eigo/).

2. It provides a docker image, available on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/tgmgroup/docker-scrabble), that can easily be used to create multiple versions of this game for different classes. If there is demand for it, I will create a version of this docker image without simplifications. Please notify me of issues or requests at the Github page (https://github.com/tgmgroup/Scrabble-for-New-Horizon)
